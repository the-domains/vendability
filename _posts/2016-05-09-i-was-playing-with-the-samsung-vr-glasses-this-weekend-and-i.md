I was playing with the Samsung VR glasses this weekend and I was reflecting on how much fun it will be to develop a VR store experience. 

Think of the impact on the shopping experience, when one can now allow the shopper to walk around a store, which can now be merchandised dynamically based on the customer's preferences. If they're a size 2, between 18 and 24 who loves turquoise, we can build them a magnificent shop and merchandise it with relevant product they can interact with in 360 degrees.

Of course this will require an immense amount of additional work from a store design perspective, not least of which is the need for excellent product photography. In addition, to create a truly personalized experience will require an immense amount of processing power to regenerate product sets and store layouts dynamically.
